# CIFAR-10 CNN Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN architecture implementation
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of training metrics

## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
